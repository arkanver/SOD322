Info:
Feel free to use these lines as you wish. This program loads an unweighetd graph in main memory as an adjacency matrix.

To compile:
"gcc adjmatrix.c -O9 -o adjmatrix".

To execute:
"./adjmatrix edgelist.txt".
"edgelist.txt" should contain the graph: one edge on each line (two unsigned long (nodes' ID)) separated by a space.
The prograph will load the graph in main memory and then terminate.

Note:
If the graph is directed (and weighted) with selfloops and you want to make it undirected unweighted without selfloops, use the following linux command line.
awk '{if ($1<$2) print $1" "$2;else if ($2<$1) print $2" "$1}' net.txt | sort -n -k1,2 -u > net2.txt

Performence:
Up to 200.000 nodes on my laptop with 8G of RAM.
Takes more or less 4G of RAM and 10 seconds (I have an SSD hardrive) for 100.000 nodes.
